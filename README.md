This is a site that I created to help with creating a reflection entry based on the book LifePass by Payal Kadakia ( ClassPass Founder )

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, install dependencies using your preferred package manager 
```bash
npm install
or 
yarn instaall
```
Secondly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.


## Live Instance

A live instance of the application is deployed on vercel via [https://lifepass-reflection.vercel.app/](https://lifepass-reflection.vercel.app/)
